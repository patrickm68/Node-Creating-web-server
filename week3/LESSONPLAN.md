## Core concepts

## Build with students

1. A node js that consumes an external API e.g. https://randomfox.ca/floof/
   in stage 1 node should redirect to the url in the json
2. Make the application server inline HTML that uses the image url
   discuss how HTML code and javascript are mixed and how this lead to tempating engines
3. Use pug to refactor the app from step 2
