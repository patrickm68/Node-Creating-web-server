# Node JS Class

## Homework Week 3

### Create Node JS server that:

- Listens on port 8080

- Responds to these endpoints:
	- GET /todos/
		- Returns list of todos
	- POST /todos/
		- add a todo to the list and return the new list
	- DELETE /todos/`<todo index>`
		- remove a todo and return the new list
	- DELETE /todos/
		- clear all the todos from the list
		
All responses should be in JSON. There is a commented out example in my index.js

### Notes

A front-end html page that makes the correct calls and displays the results is supplied. 

Don't edit the html page. If you find en error in the page please let me know straight away so I can fix it for everyone.

I have supplied a skeleton index.js that serves the home page at http://localhost:8080/. You can build on it or create your own.

Please excuse the ugliness of my html! I will try to pretty it up later but I will not change any logic.
