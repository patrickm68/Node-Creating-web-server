### 1.1 Chuck Norris programs do not accept input.

Did you you know that there is an API for Chuck Noris jokes. That's incredibly, right?

Write a small node program (not a server) that calls the this API http://www.icndb.com/api/ and prints a random joke to the conole.

Hint: You need to install and require `node-fetch`.
Hint: Print the entire response to the concole to see how it is structured.
