## Week goals

This week we will look into enhancing your API. One thing to keep in mind that your own API can make use of other API's for certain functionality! In fact, this happens all the time and is a great way to split the separation of concerns. Have a look at how this works [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/node-js/consuming-apis.md).

Next we are going to look at what we call a templating engine. This can make a web server host dynamic html which can be useful for certain applications. Have a look at it [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/node-js/templating.md).
