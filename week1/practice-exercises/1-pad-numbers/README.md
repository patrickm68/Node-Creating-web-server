# Pad numbers

Lets practice how to use code from other developers in our applications. In the file `/1-pad-numbers/padLeft.js` you will find a function I wrote the other day. Study the function and read the description to understand what it does.

Your task is to use this function in another file `1-pad-number/script.js`. Open the file and follow the instructions.
