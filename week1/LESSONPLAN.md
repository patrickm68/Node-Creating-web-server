## Agenda

1. Recap javascript3

4. Node.js hands on, basic example
   * how to run a script
   * where to find documentation
5. Client-server model (introduce URL endpoints and ports)
     * introduce HTTP. students need to know about request and response and content types, leave methods and status codes and body for week2
6. NPM - explain `require` with a local file (see code-width-students). Then `npm init`. Finally explain `npm install` (don't go into details of dependencies vs devDependencies and global vs local, its too much)

8. Briefly explain homework assignment
