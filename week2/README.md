## Week goals

This week we are going to learn some more terms that come up when discussing API's. Let's first start with the term CRUD, read about what this is [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/definitions/crud). Next we will look into HTTP methods that are a part of the HTTP protocol we learned about last week, read about them [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/the-internet/http-methods).

You might have noticed that the four CRUD actions nicely align with the HTTP methods:

1. Create -> POST
2. Read -> GET
3. Update -> PUT
4. Delete -> DELETE

Having covered these terms we can now look into one of the most common API architectures, the REST API. Have a look at the explanation of this design [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/the-internet/designing-apis.md). 

Lastly, testing your API's without a frontend is a little cumbersome. Have a look at the tool Postman that is used a lot to test out API's [here](https://study.hackyourfuture.net/#/tools/postman.md)
