## 1. What does Representational State Transfer (REST) mean?

Building software is like building houses: architecture is everything. In order to make sure it is built to last, all parts must be planned, organised and managed in order to create the best user experience.

REST is a specific architectural style for backend applications. It serves to organise code in predictable ways, both for the server and for the client.

## 2. What is a CRUD application?

CRUD is short for Create, Read, Update and Delete: the four actions that any backend application should be able to handle. This is separate from which programming language you might use to create the app; Java, Ruby, PHP or Node.js.

The CRUD structure responds to the user's need to create new data, to be able to read (display in the user interface) it, to update old data and finally to delete it. It is directly

Let's use a common example to illustrate this

1. **Create**.
2. **Read**.

4. **Delete**.

## 2. What are endpoints and routes?

Now that you've gained some experience writing server-side code we're going one layer deeper. You must
