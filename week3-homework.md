## Homework Week 3

Create Node JS server that:

- Listens on port 8080

- Responds to these endpoints:
	- /todos/list
		- Returns list of todos
	- /todos/add
		- add a todo to the list and return the new list
	- /todos/remove
		- remove a todo and return the new list
	- /todos/reset
		- clear all the todos from the list
- Looks for the correct http method in the request

A front-end html page that makes the correct calls and displays the results will be supplied. Don't edit the html page.
