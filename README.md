# Module #5: Understand backend: creating web servers with JavaScript using Node.js (Backend)

![NodeJS](./assets/nodejs.png)

So far you've learned about the fundamentals of what makes up a webpage in your browser. We call this `frontend`: the HTML that gives structure to our pages, the CSS that give it a nice look, and lastly the JavaScript that makes our page interactive. Everything you can "see" and "interact" with is made out of these technologies.

However, there is a whole other layer to the cake that you might not be aware of. Have you ever wondered how data moves from one place to another, from one page to another? This is where `backend` comes into play: all the parts of an application that can't directly be accessed by the user, but happen "behind the screen". Essentially what's happening is that it's the code that tells the computer how to move and manipulate data.

During the following 3 weeks you'll be learning one **approach** of creating a backend. As a tool to illustrate these concepts we will be using `Node.js`: software that allows us to use the language of JavaScript to be written and executed outside of the browser.

## Learning goals

In this module you will get familiar with the world of backend development. By the end of it you have learned:

- What is meant by the term `backend`
- The `client-server` model
- What HTTP and REST mean
- How to `create your own web servers` with Node.js, using `Express.js`
- What a `templating engine` is.
- How to use the `Node Package Manager (NPM)`.
- How to use Express.js to make a `RESTful API`
- How to build a small `full-stack application`

## Before you start

Before you start you need to install a very important software: Node.js! We're going to use the latest stable version of it, which is **v10.x**. Click on the following link to download it to your computer:

- For [Ubuntu](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#debinstall)
- For [macOS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- For [Windows](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Verify the installation by running `node -v` (-v is short for version) from the Command Line. It should say: `v10.14.2` or a later version than that.
