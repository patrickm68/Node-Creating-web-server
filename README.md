# HackYourFuture - Node.js

This 3-week HYF Module is about Node.js. We can think of Node.js as "Javascript not running in a browser". This is what we mean by "backend", as in "backend developer".

## Planning

| Week | Topic              | Read                              | Homework                           |
| ---: | ------------------ | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
|   0. | Introduction       | [Week 0 Reading](week0/README.md) | None                               |
|   1. | Node.js, NPM, http | [Week 1 Reading](week1/README.md) | [Week 1 Homework](week1/MAKEME.md) |
|   2. | fs, process        | [Week 2 Reading](week2/README.md) | [Week 2 Homework](week2/MAKEME.md) |
|   3. | express, REST      | [Week 3 Reading](week3/README.md) | [Week 3 Homework](week3/MAKEME.md) |


## Pre-requisites

We will build on knowledge from the following HYF (sub)modules. If we feel we have gaps we should review the curriculum ourselves or ask a teacher to help.

- [JavaScript](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/JavaScript)
- [Git](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Git)
- [Bash/CommandLineInterface](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/CommandLine)

## What will we learn?

- What is Node.js?
- Using Node Package Manager (NPM)
- Using `require` to include modules
- Using `http` to handle and respond to HTTP requests
- Using `fs` to read from and write to files
- Using `process` to read arguments from command line
- Using `express` to make a RESTful API

## Why Node.js?

It is essential to have a backend for almost all web application. The backend is a place where we, developers, can store our data, communicate with users and let users communicate with us, do smart things like calculations, data processing, etc.

There are many languages for this. You might've heard of Java, C, C++, C#, Go, Python, Ruby, PHP and [so on](https://blog.newrelic.com/2016/08/18/popular-programming-languages-2016-go/).

There are two reasons why we at HYF chose Node.js over others:

1. You already know JavaScript, so it's easier to get started;
2. Node.js is great for making web APIs because it is asynchronous by nature and thus allows for high throughput, so it allows many users to make very light requests at the same time.

## Handing in homework

Also review the [Git workflow material](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Git/blob/master/Lecture-3.md) and use it as a reference.
