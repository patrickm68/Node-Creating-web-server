NodeJS 101 course

## Pre-requisites

### Bash Shell

Much of the course will be done on the command line so it's important to be familiar with it. We will use the BASH shell. If you are running OSX or Linux then you already have this. If you are on Windows then these are your options:

* Built in Windows 10 Bash shell. If you have the latest Windows 10 anniversary update you can activate a native Bash shell. I haven't tried this myself yet. If it works well it should be the best option. See instructions here: [How to Install and Use the Linux Bash Shell on Windows 10](http://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/)

* Git Bash. This comes with Git for windows and should already be installed if you have installed Git. If not you can re-install git and make sure it is selected. [Git for windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

* Cygwin. Cygwin is like installing a virtual Linux on your PC. Very powerful, with many options, but not the best choice if you don't like spending time configuring things. [Cygwin project](https://www.cygwin.com/)

Please look at this tutorial to help you get up to speed with using the command line: [Digital Ocean - getting started with Linux](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/getting-started-with-linux)

### Git

Git is required to upload your homework. You will need:

* A github account. Sign up here [GitHub](https://github.com)

* Git installed on your laptop All installers are here: [Git SCM](https://git-scm.com/downloads). If you are running Linux you can also install by using the package manager of your distribution.

* A working knowledge of using git. Here is a short tutorial [Digital Ocean Git tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-git-effectively). Here is a cheat sheet. Print out and keep next to you :-) [Git cheat sheet](https://services.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf). If you want to deep dive you can get this free book [Pro-Git](https://progit2.s3.amazonaws.com/en/2016-03-22-f3531/progit-en.1084.pdf).

### Node.js 

Obviously you need Node.js installed to use :-) The installer for your OS can be downloaded from their website [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). If you are running Linux you can also install by using the package manager of your distribution. Please install the 'Current' version 6.6.
