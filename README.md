# Creating web servers with Node.js: understanding backend through JavaScript

During the following 3 weeks you'll be learning about various concepts that deal with what we programmers call `backend`: the parts of an application that can't directly be accessed by the user, and deals with all processes related to moving and manipulating data.

As a tool to illustrate these concepts will be using `Node.js`: software that allows you to use the language of JavaScript to be written and executed outside of the browser.

## Learning goals

In this module you will get familiar with the world of backend development. By the end of it you have learned:

- What is meant by the term `backend`.
- The `client-server` model.
- How to `create your own servers` with Node.js, using `Express`
- What a `templating engine` is.
- How to use the `Node Package Manager (NPM)`.
- How to use `Express` to make a RESTful API
- How to build a small `full-stack application`

## Node.js Setup

We're going to use the latest stable version of Node.js, which is v10.x. Click on the following link to download it to your computer:

- For [Ubuntu](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#debinstall)
- For [macOS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- For [Windows](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

To check if you have the minimum required version, type `node -v` (-v is short for version) into the Command Line.

## Handing in homework

Take a look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0yomUVVpU)
made by Daan, he explains how your homework needs to be handed in from now on.

Also review the [Git workflow material](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Git/blob/master/Lecture-3.md)
and use it as a reference.
