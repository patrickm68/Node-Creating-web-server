# Creating web servers with Node.js: understanding backend through JavaScript

During the following 3 weeks you'll be learning about various concepts that deal with what we programmers call `backend`: the parts of an application that can't directly be accessed by the user, and deals with all processes related to moving and manipulating data.

As a tool to illustrate these concepts we will be using `Node.js`: software that allows us to use the language of JavaScript to be written and executed outside of the browser.

## Planning

| Week | Topic                               | Readings                       | Homework                                | Lesson Plan                               |
| ---: | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
|   1. | Client-server model, HTTP & Express | [Readings W1](week1/README.md) | [Homework W1](week1/homework/README.md) | [Lesson Plan W1](week1/lecture/README.md) |
|   2. | REST, CRUD & API                    | [Readings W2](week2/README.md) | [Homework W2](week2/homework/README.md) | [Lesson Plan W2](week2/lecture/README.md) |
|   3. | Templating engines, API calls       | [Readings W3](week3/README.md) | [Homework W3](week3/homework/README.md) | [Lesson Plan W3](week3/lecture/README.md) |

## Learning goals

In this module you will get familiar with the world of backend development. By the end of it you have learned:

- What is meant by the term `backend`
- The `client-server` model
- What HTTP and REST mean
- How to `create your own servers` with Node.js, using `Express`
- What a `templating engine` is.
- How to use the `Node Package Manager (NPM)`.
- How to use `Express` to make a RESTful API
- How to build a small `full-stack application`

## Node.js Setup

We're going to use the latest stable version of Node.js, which is **v10.x**. Click on the following link to download it to your computer:

- For [Ubuntu](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#debinstall)
- For [macOS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- For [Windows](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Verify the installation by running `node -v` (-v is short for version) from the Command Line. It should say: `v10.14.2` or something similar.

## A note on the homework

Every week you'll be reading about various backend concepts and then have homework that will help you practice what you've learned. Each week's homework consists of 2 parts:

1. Doing exercises to practice with the concepts
2. Building on a mini full-stack application, called **HackYourTemperature**

Here's how it will [look](https://quiet-sea-26203.herokuapp.com/). It might not look like much, but a lot is happening on the backend.

## Handing in homework

Take a look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0yomUVVpU)
made by Daan, he explains how your homework needs to be handed in.

Also review the [Git workflow material](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Git/blob/master/Lecture-3.md)
